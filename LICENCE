MIT License
The MIT License is a widely used open-source software license that grants broad permission for reuse with minimal conditions. It allows developers to freely use, copy, modify, and distribute software, provided the original copyright and license notice are retained. Its simplicity and permissiveness have made it one of the most popular licenses globally. 

Key facts
Type: Permissive open-source license

Origin: Massachusetts Institute of Technology

SPDX identifier: MIT

OSI approved: Yes

Primary condition: Must include copyright and license notice

Core principles
The MIT License’s defining feature is its permissiveness. It imposes virtually no restrictions on how the software can be used—commercially or privately—as long as attribution is preserved. The text grants rights “to deal in the Software without restriction,” encompassing use, modification, distribution, sublicensing, and sale, while disclaiming all warranties and liability. 

Comparison and variants
The license is considered functionally equivalent to the BSD 3-Clause License and similar permissive licenses, but is shorter and simpler. A variant, MIT-0, removes the requirement to include the copyright notice, offering even fewer obligations. 

Adoption and influence
Because of its clarity and commercial friendliness, the MIT License is favored in many programming communities and platforms, including projects on GitHub, npm, and RubyGems. It underpins numerous influential open-source projects across industries, from web frameworks to operating systems. 

Legal and practical considerations
While highly permissive, the license’s warranty disclaimer means software is provided “as is,” protecting authors from liability. Its minimalism supports interoperability and reuse, but it also means licensors cannot control derivative use or redistribution once code is released.
